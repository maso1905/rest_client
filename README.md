# rest_client

## Summary

This project is an application for consuming a REST webservice. The REST webservice can be found in my "rest_webservice" repo. 
This application is using Fetch API for GET, POST, PUT (in progress) and DELETE. The REST webservice is uploaded on a public
server using MySQL which presents courses I have finished at Mid University, Web development program. Since this project were
more focused on functionality and backend programming, the frontend have not been prioritized.

## How To Use

With this application you can create a new course with the provided form.
You can also delete an existing course. Later you are going to be able to
update a course as well but its not avilable at the moment.
